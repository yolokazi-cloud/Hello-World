# Hello-World

//Hi everyone reading this

//I really enjoy using the .NET Framework coding using c# programming language because in future I would like to be Database Administrator or Backend Web Application Designer.
//However, I do also enjoy using Java and developing applications using the language with the knowledge I have learned thus far in this semester, I also started getting //accustomed to JavaScript basic knowledge theoretically and programmically during my leisure time, so perhaps I might be a JavaScript developer.
